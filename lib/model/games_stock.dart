Two years later, Shepard learns from the Illusive Man, the leader of Cerberus, that numerous human colonies are vanishing, but the latter does not know why. After Shepard visits a colony that was recently attacked by these unknown belligerents, he learns that the belligerents are in fact Collectors, the same species that was behind the downing of the Normandy.

In response to this growing threat posed by the Collectors, Shepard creates a team made up of former squad members from the first Mass Effect was well as of new recruits. However, Shepard also must make the proper preparations necessary to confront the Collectors with the fewest casualties possible.',

Amidst the wreckage of his plane Jack spots and swims to a lighthouse and boards a Bathysphere that takes him deep within the ocean and into Rapture. Originally conceived as a utopia where a man would be entitled to all that he made without the interference of "parasites" by idealistic billionaire mogul Andrew Ryan. Rapture has since decayed and festered from the infectious effects of civil war and anarchy, brought about by the very ideals it citizens and it\'s leader embrace. Aided by a sympathetic smuggler and a rogue geneticist, Jack salvages gene altering chemicals transforming himself into a superhuman, and uses his newfound powers and abilities as well as an arsenal of weapons to fend off the vicious hordes of psychotic mutants, security robots and armored supersoldiers that resulted from Rapture\'s unrest while given the choice to either rescue or lethally harvest the genetic material from Rapture\'s only citizens with a chance: the 10 year old "Little Sisters". As Jack wanders through the condemning atmosphere of rapture, he treads towards a secret that could shatter all that he has known forever. ',
